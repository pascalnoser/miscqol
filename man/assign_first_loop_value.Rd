\title{Assign the loop variable to the first value in its sequence}
\usage{
assign_first_loop_value()
}
\description{

extracts the loop variable and the loop expression, then assigns the variable
to the first element of the expression in the current R session.
}
\details{
#' @details
The function only looks at the single line where the cursor is positioned.
Multi-line loop headers are not supported. It recognizes variable names
consisting of letters, digits, underscores, or dots. Trailing comments (\verb{# ...}) and optional braces after the \code{for} statement are tolerated.

Supported loop forms include (with or without trailing \verb{\{} or comments):
\itemize{
\item \verb{for (i in 1:10)}
\item \verb{for(i in seq_along(x))\{}
\item \verb{for (element_name in names(ls_elements))}
\item \verb{for(value in myfun(x, y)) # with trailing comment}
}
}
